Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of doubly linked list.

- Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

- Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

- Prev − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the previous link called Prev.

- LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First and to the last link called Last.
