## Single Linked Lists

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

- Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

- Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

- LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

## Basic Operations

- **Insertion** − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

- **Deletion** − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

- **Display** − Displays the complete list.

- **Search** − Searches an element using the given key.

- **Delete** − Deletes an element using the given key.

## Advantages

A singly linked linear list is a recursive data structure, because it contains a pointer to a smaller object of the same type. For that reason, many operations on singly linked linear lists (such as merging two lists, or enumerating the elements in reverse order) often have very simple recursive algorithms, much simpler than any solution using iterative commands. While those recursive solutions can be adapted for doubly linked and circularly linked lists, the procedures generally need extra arguments and more complicated base cases.
