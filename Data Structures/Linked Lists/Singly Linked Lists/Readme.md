```
+-----+-----+     +-----+-----+     +-----+------+
|  1  |  n ---->  |  2  |  n ---->  |  3  | NULL |
+-----+-----+     +-----+-----+     +-----+------+

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

- Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

- Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

- LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

## Basic Operations

- **Insertion** − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

- **Deletion** − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

- **Search** − Searches an element using the given key.

- **Delete** − Deletes an element using the given key.
