# Binary Search Tree

A Binary Search Tree has following properties :  
1. The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
2. The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
4. There must be no duplicate nodes.

Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be defined as −

```
left_subtree (keys)  ≤  node (key)  ≤  right_subtree (keys)
```
