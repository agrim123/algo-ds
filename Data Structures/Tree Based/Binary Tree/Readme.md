# Binary Tree

Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes.  
A tree whose `elements have at most 2 children` is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we name them the left and right child.  
A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.  
A tree is represented by a pointer to the topmost node in tree. If the tree is empty, then value of root is NULL.  
A Tree node contains following parts.
1. Data
2. Pointer to left child
3. Pointer to right child

## Properties

1. The maximum number of nodes at level `l` of a binary tree is `2^(l-1)`.
2. Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height `h` is `2h â€“ 1`.
3. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  `Log2(N+1)`
4. A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least `(Log2L) + 1`   levels.
5. In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

## Types of Binary Trees

1. **Full Binary Tree** : A Binary Tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children.
2. **Complete Binary Tree**: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible
3. **Perfect Binary Tree**: A Binary tree is Perfect Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at same level.
4. **Balanced Binary Tree**
